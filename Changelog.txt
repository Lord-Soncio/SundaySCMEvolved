buildings
- rebalanced cyberpsionic transmuter to have equal output value for each colony designation
decisions
~ fixed most habitat decision missing check for planet modifiers although having the modifiers already in place
- tripled the cost of alloys for habitats unique deposits decisions, replaced unity cost with influence (so to match the gate currency used by evolved, aka influence)
- increased the cost of alloys for GPM standard decisions
defines
~ decreased resolution vote time to 2 years
~ decreased resolution recess time to 1 years
- increased federation opposing ethic penalty
+ increased cohesion range (was 100, now 300) (more cohesive federation will have the chance to grow faster if played accordingly)
- reduced by 20% branch office conversion rate (was 50% of planet trade value, now is 40%)
- increased the additional cost for each jump of distance for branch offices (to promote less sniping branch offices on the other side of the galaxy by only one megacorp)
[- increased passive war exhaustion gain]()
[- slightly increased empire size cost penalty for research]()
[+ changed claim gal.com. favor resource from influence to unity]()
[+ increased colony base building slots ( 1 -> 2 )]()
deposits
- nerfed most habitat unique deposits decisions to grant less districts slots and/or less jobs
~ added new unique deposit giving food jobs, took some of the modifiers grantig researcher jobs and switched them to food harvester jobs
diplomacy economy
- federation influence upkeep now scales based on members count (1 influence for each member)
diplomatic actions
~ hard coded the limit to create federations/subjugate/become subjugated to match rules (xenophiles can always, non xenophobe can after year 30, xenophobe and gestalt can after year 50)
megastructures
+ halfed build time of most megastructures (not included, orbital rings, habitats, old refineries/mining drills)

Â£

AI personalities
+ removed xenophobic fallen empire request to keep clear borders (due to player's capital spawning inside those systems at game start)
planet classes
[-][ reworked ancient arcaeopolis districts (now using standard districts) ]
policies
> - increased upkeep from evolved civic drone overclock (too much research for too low cost)
pop jobs
- massively increased habitat unique deposits jobs consumer goods upkeep, largely reduced jobs production
- substantially increased calculator drone jobs upkeep
- slightly reduced assembler drone monthly assembly production
[~ hydro relay drones now have both the output and upkeep (had no job upkeep) of a calculator drone ]()
scripted values
- reworked cyberpsionic buildings entropy scaling formula (was sqrt(x), is now sqrt(3(x-1)) ) (less early production while still being decent lategame)
scripted effects
- hardcoded habitat amount limit ( cap = 5, 10 if VD origin)
starbase modules
- limited amount of detection arrays on a single starbase to 6 (reaching detection lvl 10 was too easy thanks to evolved additional slots, while still possible it requires a matching investment to cloack lvl 10)
static modifiers
[- heavily nerfed some of the machine worlds GPM special decision (flat bonuses 4 -> 1)]()
technology 
[- shield and armor technologies now also grant a small amount of hardening (enhanced for rare techs, reduced for repeatables)]()
traditions
- psionics tree now requires at least 2 ascension perks before being available (slowed downt to match other AP paths timings)
events
[- mercenary enclave upgrade cost increased (cost matches the following formula, 1 additional merc naval cap = 100 alloys, 200 EC)]()
