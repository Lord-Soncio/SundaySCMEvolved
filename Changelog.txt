Buildings
- Rebalanced cyberpsionic transmuter to have equal output value for each colony designation
Decisions
~ Fixed most habitat decision missing check for planet modifiers although having the modifiers already in place
- Tripled the cost of alloys for habitats unique deposits decisions, replaced unity cost with influence (so to match the gate currency used by evolved, aka influence)
- Increased the cost of alloys for GPM standard decisions
Defines
~ Decreased resolution vote time to 2 years
~ Decreased resolution recess time to 1 years
- Increased federation opposing ethic penalty
+ Increased cohesion range (was 100, now 300) (more cohesive federation will have the chance to grow faster if played accordingly)
- Reduced by 20% branch office conversion rate (was 50% of planet trade value, now is 40%)
- Increased the additional cost for each jump of distance for branch offices (to promote less sniping branch offices on the other side of the galaxy by only one megacorp)
- Increased passive war exhaustion gain
- Slightly increased empire size cost penalty for research
+ Changed claim gal.com. favor resource from influence to unity
+ Increased colony base building slots ( 1 -> 2 )
Deposits
- Nerfed most habitat unique deposits decisions to grant less districts slots and/or less jobs
~ Added new unique deposit giving food jobs, took some of the modifiers grantig researcher jobs and switched them to food harvester jobs
Diplomacy economy
- Federation influence upkeep now scales based on members count (1 influence for each member)
Diplomatic actions
~ Hard coded the limit to create federations/subjugate/become subjugated to match rules (xenophiles can always, non xenophobe can after year 30, xenophobe and gestalt can after year 50)
Megastructures
+ Halfed build time of most megastructures (not included, orbital rings, habitats, old refineries/mining drills)
Â£
AI personalities
+ Removed xenophobic fallen empire request to keep clear borders (due to player's capital spawning inside those systems at game start)
Planet classes
- Reworked ancient arcaeopolis districts (now using standard districts)
Policies
- Increased upkeep from evolved civic drone overclock (too much research for too low cost)
Pop jobs
- Massively increased habitat unique deposits jobs consumer goods upkeep, largely reduced jobs production
- Substantially increased calculator drone jobs upkeep
- Slightly reduced assembler drone monthly assembly production
~ Hydro relay drones now have both the output and upkeep (had no job upkeep) of a calculator drone
Scripted values
- Reworked cyberpsionic buildings entropy scaling formula (was sqrt(x), is now sqrt(3(x-1)) ) (less early production while still being decent lategame)
Scripted effects
- Hardcoded habitat amount limit ( cap = 5, 10 if VD origin)
Starbase modules
- Limited amount of detection arrays on a single starbase to 6 (reaching detection lvl 10 was too easy thanks to evolved additional slots, while still possible it requires a matching investment to cloack lvl 10)
Static Modifiers
- Heavily nerfed some of the machine worlds GPM special decision (flat bonuses 4 -> 1)
Technology 
- Shield and Armor technologies now also grant a small amount of hardening (enhanced for rare techs, reduced for repeatables)
Traditions
- Psionics tree now requires at least 2 ascension perks before being available (slowed downt to match other AP paths timings)
Events
- Mercenary enclave upgrade cost increased (cost matches the following formula, "1 additional merc naval cap = 100 Alloys, 200 EC")
